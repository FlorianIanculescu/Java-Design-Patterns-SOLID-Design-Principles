## Introduction

Design patterns represent solutions to common problems, which you face while doing programming. These solutions are reusable and can solve a wide variety of problems. These became popular with the release of classic book on the subject "Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" writtern by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (these authors are known as Gang of Four and so the common abbreviation GoF book :) ) 

SOLID is an acronym representing five design principles that help create maintainable and extensible software. These principles guide developers in writing clean and flexible code

## Course Content

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific topic. The modules are as follows:

1. SOLID Design Principles: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle
2. Creational Design Patterns: Builder, Simple Factory, Factory Method, Prototype, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Object Pool
3. Structural Design Patterns: Adapter, Bridge, Decorator, Composite, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
4. Behavioral Design Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Mediator, Iterator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor, Null Object
    
## What I learned

- 26 design patterns including 23 design patterns of gang of four & other new modern design patterns
- The SOLID design principles using Java with hands on examples along with design patterns
- Get a complete understanding of Java design patterns & understand where to use them in Java code
- The differences between competing design patterns to choose correct solution to your problem
- Real world examples of design patterns usage with hands on projects for every design pattern
- Understand & implement all creational, structural & behavioral gang of four design patterns using Java
- Understand & implement Null Object, Object Pool design patterns using Java
- Comprehensive knowledge about limitations, comparisons, real world usage & hand on examples of design patterns using Java

## Certification
