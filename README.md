## Introduction

Design patterns represent solutions to common problems, which you face while doing programming. These solutions are reusable and can solve a wide variety of problems. These became popular with the release of classic book on the subject "Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" writtern by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (these authors are known as Gang of Four and so the common abbreviation GoF book :) ) 

## Course Content

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific topic. The modules are as follows:

1. SOLID Design Principles
2. Creational Design Patterns: Builder, Simple Factory, Factory Method, Prototype, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Object Pool
3. Structural Design Patterns: Adapter, Bridge, Decorator, Composite, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
4. Behavioral Design Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Mediator, Iterator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor, Null Object
